Rubric:

Listed below are the requirements to pass this project.

* In models.py, specify the CNN architecture; define a convolutional neural network with at least one convolutional layer, i.e. self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3).

* In notebook 2, you should train the network after defining its loss and optimization functions. You are encouraged, but not required, to visualize their loss over time/epochs by printing it out occasionally and/or plotting the loss over time.

* After training, all questions in notebook 2 about model architecture and choice of loss function are answered.

* In notebook 2, visualize one or more learned feature maps

* In notebook 3, use a haar cascade face detector to detect faces in a given image

* In notebook 3, process each image of a face into the shape your model from notebook 2 expects

* In notebook 3, apply your trained network to the image and display detected key points on a face.



For testers:

Please answer the following questions, as I'm aimiing to improve and add to this project:

* How could this project be improved?
* Where were the instructions most confusing?

* Would you like the ability to overlay simple graphics on a face -- i.e sunglasses on detected eye keypoints?
* Would you like to learn how to group faces by pose (facing left/right/etc) using unsupervised clustering like k-means?

Thank you so much for your time!
