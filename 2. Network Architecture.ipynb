The structure of this Net class is shown below and left for you to fill in.\n",

Next, run your trained model on these images to see what kind of keypoints are produced. You should be able to see if your model is fitting each new face it sees, if the points are distributed randomly, or if the points have actually overfitted the training data and do not generalize."

CNN's are actually learning to recognize a variety of spatial patterns and you can visualize what each convolutional layer has been trained to recognize by looking at the weights that make up each convolutional kernel and applying those one at a time to a sample image. This technique is called feature visualization and it's useful for understanding the inner workings of a CNN."
